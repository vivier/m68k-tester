distribution for details.


Overview
--------

m68k-tester is aimed at being useful to M680x0 emulator authors to
debug their CPU engine. It's originally designed to cope with results
files generated by Ray Arachelian on his NeXT machine (68040).


Requirements
------------

You need the results files:
<http://gwenole.beauchesne.info/projects/68ktester/files/m68k-tests.tar.bz2>

You need a precompiled M680x0 emulation engine available in object
form (.o files packed into a libemu68k.a static archive) along with
the necessary headers.

Other specific software:
  - GNU make


Quick build instructions
------------------------

Carefully edit the Makefile for emulator specific defines. They have
to match what your emulator's configure script generated. Otherwise,
some data structures won't be of the same size, thus possibly placing
your emulator data to the wrong location.

Define the following variables at the make command line or in the Makefile:
  EMULATOR         name of the emulator (BasiliskII, Aranym, {,E-}UAE, QEMU)
  EMULATOR_PATH    path to the emulator (actually, emulator headers)
  MEMORY           memory addressing mode to use (real, direct, banks)
